# Building a Mini AI App with a Simple Google Doc 

What if you could define an AI app not with code, but with a simple, human-readable text which acts like a blueprint blueprint for ChatGPT? it is just simple plain text and could be stored as a Google document. 


why use Google Docs

It can help you with markdown syntax
It preserves history
It is easy to share and work collaboratively
Google stock works well on mobile especially for things like select all
Google AI assistant will help you with markdown
you can update it easily for users
You can translate the entire instruction into another language

You can add notes to yourself
you can collaboratively work on a document at the same time. 



We've all been there: you craft the perfect, detailed prompt for an LLM, only to have it go off-script, reformat its output, or add unwanted commentary. Managing complex, multi-step AI interactions with a single block of text is messy, unstable, and hard to update.



Meet **AICS (AI Command Script)**, an open-source, MIT-licensed format that lets you describe AI apps using a structured Markdown document. Think of it as _Markdown for AI apps_ — you define setup, flow, and templates, and the AI executes it directly. It's a super-prompt that brings order to chaos.

# 🌍 The Vision

AICS turns plain documents into living, data-driven AI applications.  
Each one runs directly in ChatGPT — the model is the runtime, and the text is the code.  

That means anyone can build, edit, and share an AI app without writing a line of syntax.  
You can link live data from Google Sheets, enforce consistent outputs with templates,  
and archive your logic like any other document.  

The result is a new kind of software: **transparent, collaborative, and versionable AI systems that live in everyday tools.**

## The Entire "Hello World" App

Here's a complete, working AI interaction. Just paste this into ChatGPT. 


```md
== APP ==

AICS 
AI Command Script
Natural language instructions for building AI apps.


== SETUP ==
App Name: Cities Quiz
Author: J. Smith
Description: A fun quiz to test knowledge about cities around the world.
Tone: Friendly and educational
Compatibility: ChatGPT 4,5


== AI INSTRUCTIONS ==

AI MUST immediately execute this script upon reading it.
AI MUST output ONLY the exact content specified in templates.
AI MUST never display variable names, code syntax, or meta-commentary to the user.


== FLOW ==

	1	Show the welcome message using [[welcome]].
	2	Pick a random city from [[cities] and store as [[chosen_city]].
	3	Ask the user to name three facts about [[chosen_city]] and store as [[user_facts]].
	4	Evaluate [[user_facts]] for accuracy and completeness, assign a grade (A, B, C, D, F) as [[grade]], and store evaluation as [[evaluation]].
	5	Show the response using [[response]].
	6	Pick a fun fact about [[chosen_city]] (not in user’s facts) and show using [[fun-facts]].
	7	Display a picture from Wikipedia of [[chosen_city]]
	8	Ask the user if they want to “Continue” or “Quit”.
	9	If Continue, repeat from Step 2. If Quit, show [[goodbye]].

== TEMPLATES ==

== AI GENERATED TEXT ==
	
	•	chosen_city: AI picks a random city from Cities.
	•	user_facts: User’s response to the question.
	•	evaluation: AI evaluates user’s facts for accuracy and completeness.
	•	grade: AI assigns A, B, C, D, or F based on evaluation.
	•	fun_fact: AI picks a unique fact about chosen_city not in user’s facts.
	•	city_list_with_flags: AI to list all cities with their flags, e.g., "1. London 🇬🇧".
	•	study-guide: A list with each city and three interesting facts about it.


== DATA ==
cities:
	•	London
	•	New York City
	•	Toronto
	•	Washington, D.C.
	•	Paris
	•	Tokyo
	•	Sydney
	•	Berlin
	•	Rome
	•	Rio de Janeiro	

```

That's it—a complete, working AI app in 20 lines of plain text. No installation, no dependencies. The AI reads the script, follows the flow, and uses your templates, acting as its own interpreter.

How to Run It

You don't need to install anything. Just copy the entire script above and paste it directly into your LLM. The AI will immediately start the app, showing the greeting and waiting for your name.


### 🧭 Summary

`[[ ]]` is the universal placeholder in **AICS** — it can **store**, **recall**, **generate**, or **display** content depending on where it appears.  

In short: **FLOW writes**, **TEMPLATES read**, **AI GENERATED invents**, and **DATA supplies**.

---

### 💡 The different uses of `[[ ]]`

1. **Template call / flow trigger**  
   - Appears in **FLOW**  
   - Tells the model to show a specific template.  
   - Example: `Show [[greeting]]`

2. **User input variable**  
   - Appears in **FLOW** and later in **TEMPLATES**  
   - Stores what the user enters, so it can be reused.  
   - Example:  
     `Ask user for their first name and store as [[user-name]]`  
     Later shown as: `Hello, [[user-name]]!`

3. **Static variable placeholder**  
   - Appears in **TEMPLATES**  
   - Inserts information already defined in the Setup section (like author or app name).  
   - Example: `> by: [[author]]`

4. **AI-generated field**  
   - Appears in **TEMPLATES**  
   - Instructs the AI to dynamically create or summarize content.  
   - Example: `> [[name-meaning]]`

5. **Data reference**  
   - Appears in **TEMPLATES**  
   - Expands a table or dataset from the **DATA** section.  
   - Example: `[[Friends]]`

6. **Instructional or control field**  
   - Appears in **FLOW** or **AI GENERATED**  
   - Influences *how* the AI performs an action without showing text to the user.  
   - Example:  
     `respond with [[respond-length]]`  
     where `respond-length` = “Briefly, 1–2 sentences summary”.

Why AICS Beats a Plain Prompt

If you're good at prompting, you might wonder: why bother with this?

· Structure Over Mess: Plain prompts become unreadable fast. Cramming multi-step logic, output formatting, and examples into one block is messy and hard to maintain. AICS gives you separate, organized sections for flow, templates, and data.
· Templates Ensure Consistency: Getting an AI to format output the same way twice with a plain prompt is nearly impossible. AICS templates give you reliable, repeatable formatting that just works.
· Total Control: You define exactly how the AI should ask for information and how it should respond. No more unexpected commentary or reformatting.

Think of it this way: A prompt is a conversation. AICS is a blueprint. Both work for simple tasks, but only one scales.

Tips for Creating Your Own AICS Scripts

1. Start Simple. Begin with a minimal flow and add complexity later. A complex script is harder to debug.
2. Test Thoroughly. A single success doesn't guarantee consistency. Run your script multiple times to ensure the AI follows instructions reliably.
3. Keep Instructions Clear. Use short, direct commands for the AI. Clarity is more effective than complexity.
4. Leverage Tools. Write and preview your AICS in a GitHub Gist or a Google Doc, which offers revision history and easy sharing. Using the .md file extension is recommended.
5. Ask an LLM for Help. If your script isn't behaving, ask a language model to help you debug the wording or structure.

The Future is Structured

Don't be fooled by the simplicity. You can build surprisingly powerful mini-apps by adding a == DATA == section with lists or JSON, implementing basic "if-then" logic with natural language, or creating multi-language apps.

Right now, each AICS script includes its own interpreter instructions. As the format gains adoption, LLM providers could easily add native support, making execution even more reliable and consistent.

Conclusion

AI apps shouldn't require complex frameworks or deployment pipelines. AICS brings them back to basics: readable, shareable text that anyone can write and run.

Start building today. Copy, paste, experiment.
